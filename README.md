The repository contains all the assignments accomplished in the course by the team members
  * Abhyuday Pandey
  * Srinjay Kumar
  * Kumar Shivam

The course had seven assignments, briefly,
  * Substitution Cipher - Used frequency analysis to decrypt the cipher
  * Vignere Cipher - Used ChiSquared test to decrypt the message
  * DES - Used known plain text attack to break a 3-round DES
  * AES Variation - Used chosen plaintext attack to break a weaker variation of AES
  * Permutation Substitution Cipher - Generated all the possible permutations and used method for substitution cipher to get the message
  * RSA - Used Copperfield's Theorem to decrypt an RSA encryption with small exponent
